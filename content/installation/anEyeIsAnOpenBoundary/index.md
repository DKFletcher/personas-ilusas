The artwork functions as an introversion of another artwork, [**From the Mind’s-Eye of Thoughtful Sleep**](../fromTheMindsEye/) , considering similar concepts internally as I follow the nychthemeral rhythm of my own body as it prepares to end the day.

An internal doorway within a gallery space functions as the site of the artwork, concealing a projector and faux-doorway within the adjoining room and creating an illusory space between the audience and the artwork. The life-size installation appears as though it is possible to walk-through the doorway and enter the private space, where a figure arranges objects and completes domestic tasks at a slow and rhythmic pace. After folding sheets, tidying, and tending to the body, the figure eventually falls asleep within the frames of the installation. The two-hour long installation was made as site-specific to the gallery it was exhibited in; creating footage to match the dimensions of its doorways and duration of the exhibition in an attempt to recreate the ‘actual’ space of a room within the artwork. Long periods of absence are interrupted by slow movements within the space, creating a trance-like screen of intimacy as you visually enter of leave the space. The slightly unsettling appearance of an eye can be seen above the figure, appearing to look at you before returning its attention to the figure and her movements. The voyeuristic presence of the eye attempts to remind the viewer of their own gaze; encouraging an inward glance to the self, the ‘real’ space surrounding them, and their own occupation within a room.
