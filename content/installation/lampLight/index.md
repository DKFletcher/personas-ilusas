Two fabric walls create a passageway connecting and separating two spaces, concealing and revealing each side as you walk through.

On one side cityscapes projected through fabric walls show lit windows of high-rise flats and tenement buildings, on the other sits a lamp, lighting the passageway and illuminating the entrance with warm light.

The installation attempted to create a threshold between outside and inside, using domestic objects to mirror the projected footage on the opposing side of the installation.
