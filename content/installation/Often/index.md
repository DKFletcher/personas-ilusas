20x5metres of hemmed bedsheets, curtains, and pillowcases gently oscillate within stairwells of closes in five neighbouring buildings on Kenmure St, Glasgow. Installed in each building for up to a week, the immense fabric occupies absent spaces of stairwells, spanning a length of three-stories as it cascades from the top banister through each floor. Displaced air sends waves of movement across the length of the building, echoing the shapes of a body as it occupies and move through space.

The installation was created in response to the physical and cognitive distance between neighbours of shared-buildings. The nuanced intimacy experienced by those within closes of flats is one of distance and proximity: each intimacy specific to the shared-space, without which you would cease to know one another, and through-which you come to accept one an other as part of the landscape to your home. The work becomes a ghost-like echo between occupied and unoccupied space, bringing intimacies of bedsheets and pillowcases to a collective space that remains neither inside or outside.

Working closely with themes of intimacy through dichotomies of public/private, outside/inside, the work sought to create gentle distance between one space and the next. The body of each building nurtured the intimacy of this installation: allowing architecture to draw natural boundaries around the work and create an intimate space in which to view the installation as a private member of an intimate audience.
