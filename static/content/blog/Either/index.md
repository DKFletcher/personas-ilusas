description: Within these photographic compositions I consider the vastness of a mind and its space through the conceptual body of a window. Light, manipulated through glass pains of a window, shows and shadow space as a figure moves between darkness and light. A body seems to escape its boundaries between binaries of light, eventually appearing to evaporate from physical and rational space. The series attempts to visualise the mind as it projects itself from one space to another, reimagining the space of a window as an object of cognitive transmission between conscious and subconscious states-of-mind; endlessly moving between thoughts, dreams. motions. and memories within the body.
