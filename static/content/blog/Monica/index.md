# The home and surrounding farm is cared-for by three generations of Monica's family, working cooperatively within their village to cultivate land though-out the year.
# My placement in Romania marked an important step towards the environmental-domestic practice as both site and concept. Living alongside Monica and her family encouraged a tender sensitivity to space and place which has resonated within my work in the years following. The occupation of a space grew beyond its physicality; extending the mind, memories, and emotions ot a person to the landscapes that surround them, each an extension of the other.
# Though the placement occurred over four years ago, I have found myself consistently returning to the photographs, poetry, and diaries I had made throughout my time there. Thr work I produced over four weeks has followed me through-out my developing practice and supported immeasurable progress over the years since my return. I now understand my practice to be deeply rooted in the environment I am surrounded with; finding incredible energy an responsiveness within environments and spaces I am given time to connect with.
