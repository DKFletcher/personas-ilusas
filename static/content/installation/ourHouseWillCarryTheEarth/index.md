An intuitive response to the architecture of a renovated church building, the installation sought to conceptualise and engage the action of ‘looking up’. This work considers space on a cosmic level; opening the conceptual body of a church building through the visual reflection of thoughts, dreams, and experienced of the human body. The subconscious and dream-like entity of water is echoed upon the ceiling of a church, creating a ‘pool’ above the audience and directing visual space from the ground to the roof. The audience, directly below the work, must now look above themselves. In this movement of the body, the artwork attempts to engage the mysticism of being within and surrounded by an external space from within an external body.
