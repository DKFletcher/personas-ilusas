Ongoing investigations of architectural space brought focus to the nychthemeral rhythms of its use. Pollokshaws Rd. finds itself between three areas of southside Glasgow, acting as the point of transmission between each place. As evening arrives, the street hosts hundreds of residents from surrounding areas within spreads of bars and takeaways lining the street.

Over three nights, the installation occupied windows of seven flats across 200m of Pollokshaws Rd., projecting eyes looking-out to the street below. The artwork sought to occupy spaces of night; illuminating windows above pubs, bars, and takeaways in an attempt to ‘see’ those occupying the streets below. Visible from 4pm-1am over the course of a weekend, the installation faded into backgrounds of commutes home and hazy nights out. As night progresses, inebriated eyes watch as the streets watch them back. Shortly after public buildings close the installation, too, comes to an end as it follows the residents to bed. Created in response to the evening rhythms of Pollokshaws Rd, the work attempts to engage the identity of night through the architecture of its place.
